# Game Design Pitch
This is a skeleton/reference for a game design pitch. A full design will be much longer!   

## Working Title
Your game’s title should communicate the gameplay and the style of the game 

## Concept statement  
The game in a tweet: one or two sentences at most that say what the game is and why it’s fun.  

## Target audience  
Age, gender, game or other relevant interests

## Reference
Are there simular games? what are they, how do they relate, how is your game different?

## Player experience and game POV 

- Who is the player? What is the setting? What is the fantasy the game grants the player? What emotions do you want the player to feel? What are the major phases of the player’s experience in the game?  


## Unique Selling Points
What makes your game stand out? How is it different from all other games? 

## Genre(s) 
Single genre is clearer but often less interesting. Genre combinations can be risky. Beware of ‘tired’ genres.  

## Platform(s) and primary technology 
- PC or mobile? Table or phone? 2D or 3D? Unity or Javascript?

## Visual/audio Style 
What is the "look and feel" of the game? How does this support the desired player’s experience? What concept art or reference art can you show to give the feel of the game? 




## Game Systems
What systems are needed to make this game? Which ones are internal (simulation, etc.) and which does the player interact with? 

## Interactivity
How are different kinds of interactivity used? (Perceptual, ST Cognitive, LT Cognitive, Emotional, Social, Cultural) What is the player doing Moment‐by‐moment? How does the player move through the world?  How does physics/combat/etc. work? 

## Game UI:
A clear, professional‐looking sketch of the primary game UX is helpful. 
- menu concept/wireframe
- game ui concept/wireframe
- gameover/win concept/wireframe
- highscores concept/wireframe
